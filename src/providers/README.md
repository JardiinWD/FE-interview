# Providers Documentation

Providers are higher-order components that wrap the application to provide specific functionality across the component tree. This application uses several providers to handle different aspects of the application infrastructure.

## Available Providers

| Provider                | Description                | Purpose                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `QueryProvider`         | Wrapper for React Query    | Manages data fetching, caching, and state synchronization for API calls |
| `ErrorBoundaryProvider` | Application error boundary | Catches JavaScript errors in child components and displays fallback UI  |
| `HelmetProvider`        | React Helmet integration   | Manages document head tags for SEO and metadata                         |
| `ReactRouterProvider`   | React Router configuration | Handles application routing and navigation                              |
| `ChakraProvider`        | Chakra UI theme provider   | Applies consistent styling and theme across components                  |

## Provider Structure

The providers are typically composed together in the application's entry point to create a provider tree:

```tsx
// Example App.tsx
import {
  QueryProvider,
  ErrorBoundaryProvider,
  HelmetProvider,
  ReactRouterProvider,
  ChakraProvider
} from '@/providers'

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundaryProvider>
      <HelmetProvider>
        <QueryProvider>
          <ChakraProvider>
            <ReactRouterProvider />
          </ChakraProvider>
        </QueryProvider>
      </HelmetProvider>
    </ErrorBoundaryProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Query Provider

Wraps the application with React Query's QueryClientProvider, configuring global options for data fetching, caching, and refetching strategies.

### ErrorBoundaryProvider

Implements React's Error Boundary pattern to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

### HelmetProvider

Integrates React Helmet to manage all changes to the document head, enabling dynamic title, meta tags, and other head elements for SEO and social sharing.

### ReactRouterProvider

Configures React Router with the application's route definitions, enabling navigation between different views without full page reloads.

### ChakraProvider

Applies Chakra UI theming to the application, providing consistent styling, responsive design utilities, and accessibility features.
